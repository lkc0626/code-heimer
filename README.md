### Todos:
How do we define scientific software?

How do we filter all projects in world of code

  -start with attributes in mongo

  -come up with criteria and supporting evidence 
  
Once we have a list of filtered projects, obtain their readme md files

Compile a dataset of projects, urls and their readme.mds

Work on the llm prompts and the desired output format that is parse friendly 

Run the readme.md code through LLM prompts

parse the output data into the dataset

Iteratively validate the results from above 

Once we have the dataset, use sampling for data quality
